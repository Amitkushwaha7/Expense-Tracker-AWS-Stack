# Expense Tracker App – Cloud Deployed

This is a cloud-deployed expense tracker web application built using Flask, hosted on AWS EC2, and connected to a PostgreSQL RDS database.

It allows users to organize expenses through a simple and clean web interface, featuring:

- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Filter by category, payment method, user, and date range
- View summary totals

🚀 Phase 1: Cloud Deployment

In this phase, I focused on:

- Setting up a secure and scalable cloud environment using AWS VPC
- Deploying the Flask app on an EC2 instance using Gunicorn and Nginx
- Storing data on a PostgreSQL RDS instance in a private subnet
- Logging application activity using CloudWatch Agent
- Managing configuration via a .env file and dotenv

✅ Successfully deployed the app to the cloud with persistent storage and public access via a public IP.

🔐 While a custom domain and HTTPS will be added in future phases, the current setup prioritizes security within budget limits (e.g., private RDS, strict security groups).

cd expense-tracker-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## ☁️ Deployment Steps (AWS)

This section outlines how I deployed the Flask Expense Tracker App to AWS using EC2 and RDS, with security, scalability, and observability.

1. 🧱 Infrastructure Setup (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups)

   Created a custom VPC with:

   - 1 public subnet (for EC2 instance)
   - 1 private subnet (for RDS instance)

   Configured Internet Gateway and routing tables

   Set up Security Groups:

   - EC2 SG: allows SSH (22), HTTP (80), and app port from anywhere
   - RDS SG: only allows inbound traffic from EC2 private IP range

2. 💻 EC2 Instance Setup

   Launched an Linux EC2 instance in the public subnet

   Installed:

   - Python, pip, virtualenv
   - Git, PostgreSQL client

   Cloned GitHub repo and set up Python virtual environment

   Installed app dependencies with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. 🐍 Environment Configuration

   Created a `.env` file to store environment variables (e.g. DATABASE_URI, FLASK_ENV)

   Used `python-dotenv` to load these variables into the Flask app

4. 🔧 App Server & Web Server

   Installed Gunicorn to run Flask in production mode:

   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 app:app
   ```

   Installed and configured Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward traffic to Gunicorn

   Set up Nginx to serve HTTP on port 80

5. 🗄️ RDS Setup (PostgreSQL)

   Created a PostgreSQL RDS instance in the private subnet

   Set up database schema and tested connection from EC2 instance

   Verified that all app data is being stored in RDS

6. 📊 Logging & Monitoring

   Installed and configured CloudWatch Agent to stream:

   - Gunicorn logs
   - System metrics (CPU, memory)

7. 🔐 Security Considerations

   - RDS placed in private subnet — not exposed to the internet
   - EC2 access limited to my IP (for SSH)
   - Sensitive credentials stored in `.env`, not committed to GitHub
   - HTTPS and domain name will be configured in Phase 2 to reduce initial hosting cost
